# WindowMirror

.NET app that casts a live capture of a window or monitor or any dimensions within the window. Works for windows out of focus or in the background.

This tool gives you an overlay that you can use for multitasking, watching videos, or monitoring your workspace - it was inspired by the pop-out video feature in the Opera browser. This is intended to alleviate issues with limited screen space to help productivity. I'm writing it to make my day job easier, allowing me to maintain a live view of important areas of the software I use to monitor time sensitive feeds instead of layering 6 windows just right to where I can see their individual important parts.
